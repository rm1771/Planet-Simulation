# Planet Simulation

## Overview
This project contains a Python-based simulation that models the orbits of planets in a two-dimensional space. The simulation uses Pygame to visualize the motion of planets around the sun, based on Newtonian mechanics of gravity and motion. It includes models for the Sun, Earth, Mars, Mercury, and Venus, each moving according to calculated gravitational forces.

## Features
- Visualization of planetary orbits in 2D.
- Realistic simulation of gravitational interactions between multiple celestial bodies.
- Interactive display of distance metrics and orbit paths.

## Requirements
To run this simulation, you will need Python and Pygame installed.
## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rm1771/Planet-Simulation.git
2. Install the required package:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
